    "Radar imagery can be used as a complementary dataset for Challenge 2. \n",
    "\n",
    "Radar is an active measurement technique, illuminating the Earth's surface and detecting the light scattering effects, rather than relying on the sun to illuminate the Earth, such as in passive, optical techniques. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is a form of radar often used on satellites, where the motion of the satellite over the landscape allows for higher spatial resolution measurements to be obtained. SAR measurements can penetrate cloud and smoke cover, making it particularly useful for assessing bushfires, and can also operate at night.\n",
    "\n",
    "The European Space Agency (ESA)'s Sentinel-1 mission consists of two satellites: Sentinel-1A (launched in 2014) and Sentinel-1B (launched in 2016). Each houses an SAR instrument on board. These instruments provide single C-band 1 dB radiometric accuracy with a central frequency at 5.405 GHz. \n",
    "\n",
    "Together, the Sentinel-1 satellites provide:\n",
    "- global coverage \n",
    "- frequent imaging (the satellites have a frequent revisit time of 6 days.)\n",
    "- different polarizations to capture different geospatial properties (e.g., VV, VH, as explained further below)\n",
    "- and can detect millimetre changes in elevation.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook explores the Sentinel-1 datasets. You can use these in your analysis to assist with the fire progression prediction in Chanllenge 2. \n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, this notebook shows what information we can obtain from the Sentinel-1 Radio Terrain Correction (RTC) gamma-0 data product `s1_rtc`.  The RTC gamma-0 data are corrected for variations caused by changing observation geometries."
